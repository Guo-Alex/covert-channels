This is the code for communicating across covert channels within the computer. Currently, we can communicate across
the L1, L2, and L3 cache, branch prediction, and load/store instructions.

/******** Compiling *********/

1) run configure.sh
2) run make



/******** Running **********/

For each channel of communication, there is an associated python script in the ./run/ folder. Change to the folder, and
run the scprit to initiate communication. The channel will communicate 10 times, and the number of bits sent each time 
will be displayed. After each round of communication, the results are stored in ./data/. Once the ten rounds have completed, 
the results are analyzed and percentages of bit flips are calulated. These results are stored in the 'TestResults' file in
the ./data/ folder.


/******* IMPORTANT NOTE *******/

For each channel for communication, you still need to specify which cores you want the sender and receiver to run on. This is easily done
by editing the python script in ./run/ for the channel, and replacing the core number in the taskset done. I will automate this soon, 
just trying to get virtualization working now.
